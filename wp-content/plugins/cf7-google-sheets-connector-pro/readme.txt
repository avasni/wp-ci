Send your Contact Form 7 data directly to your Google Sheets spreadsheet.

== Description ==

This plugin is a bridge between your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) forms and [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

When a visitor submits his/her data on your website via a Contact Form 7 form, upon form submission, such data are also sent to Google Sheets.

= How to Use this Plugin =

*In Google Sheets*  
* Log into your Google Account and visit Google Sheets.  
* Create a new Sheet and name it.  
* Rename the tab on which you want to capture the data. 

*In WordPress Admin*  
* Now Create or Edit the Contact Form 7 form from which you want to capture the data. Set up the form as usual in the Form and Mail etc tabs. Thereafter, go to the new "Google Sheets" tab.  
* On the "Google Sheets" tab, select the Google Sheets sheet name and tab name into respective positions, Add custom column names for all the mail tags and hit "Save".
* You can see the custom columns name to your sheet as header.

*Lastly*   
* Test your form submit and verify that the data shows up in your Google Sheet.

= Important Notes = 

* You must pay very careful attention to your naming. This plugin will have unpredictable results if names and spellings do not match between your Google Sheets and form settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the data send to spreadsheet? CF7 Submit is just Spinning. = 
Sometimes it can take a while of spinning before it goes through. But if the entries never show up in your Sheet then one of these things might be the reason:

1. Wrong access code ( Check debug log )
2. Wrong Sheet name or tab name
3. Wrong Column name mapping ( Column names are the contact form mail-tags. It cannot have underscore, space, capital letter or any special characters )

Please double-check those items and hopefully getting them right will fix the issue.

= How do I get the Google Access Code required in step 3 of Installation? =

* On the `Admin Panel > Contact form 7 > Google Sheets` screen, click the "Get Code" button.
* In a popup Google will ask you to authorize the plugin to connect to your Google Sheets. Authorize it - you may have to log in to your Google account if you aren't already logged in. 
* On the next screen, you should receive the Access Code. Copy it. 
* Now you can paste this code back on the `Admin Panel > Contact form 7 > Google Sheets` screen.
